# Oneshot-Control
A  server sided minecraft mod aimed at configuring max damage to avoid oneshots.

This mod allows you to configure how much percent hp a player or entity can loose max in one hit. 
Basically you set how many hits are needed to die, which allows a bit more counterplay opportunities than getting oneshotted.
Works great together with mods which make/add more difficult enemies, as it smoothes the scaling of those.
